Dictionaries and Setsr

Hash tables are the engines behind Python’s high-performance dicts
Other built-in types based on hash tables are set and frozenset


• Modern syntax to build and handle dicts and mappings, including enhanced unpacking and pattern matching

• Common methods of mapping types

• Special handling for missing keys

• Variations of dict in the standard library

• Thesetandfrozensettypes

• Implications of hash tables in the behavior of sets and dictionaries


Dictionaries are a keystone of Python. Over the years, the familiar {k1: v1, k2: v2} literal syntax was enhanced to support unpacking with **, pattern matching, as well as dict comprehensions.

Beyond the basic dict, the standard library offers handy, ready-to-use specialized mappings like defaultdict, ChainMap, and Counter,

A clever hook in the mapping API is the __missing__ method, which lets you cus‐ tomize what happens when a key is not found when using the d[k] syntax that invokes __getitem__.
